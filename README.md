# ChromeAppWebsite
## What is it?
This is a simple example how to create a [Chrome Web App](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps) which only display a WebSite
## Why an example for that?
I wanted to make a simple Chrome App which display a simple WebSite. I've issues with the height and the width for that frame. 
See the question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28194413/chrome-web-app-webview-height-issue/) for that.
After a quick question to an [Chromium developer](https://plus.google.com/+FrancoisBeaufort) I've found out a solution which are presented here :).
